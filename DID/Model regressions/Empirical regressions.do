* Empirical results for DID

* Explanatory variables Treat and Post have been defined for this dataset, so they are not defined here. The relevant commands are:"gen Treat=0; replace Treat=1 if Nino==1; gen Post=0; replace Post=1 if year>=2014; gen did=Treat*Post"

* Basic DID regression without control variables:

* Explanatory variable: MP
* Treat = Treatment group dummy (1=treatment, 0=control)
* Post = Time period dummy (1=post-treatment, 0=pre-treatment)
* Key regressor: did = Treat Ã— Post (interaction term, Explanatory  variable)
* Fixed effects: year and country
* Standard errors clustered at country level

reghdfe MP did, ///
    absorb(year country) ///  // Two-way fixed effects: year + country
    cluster(country)     ///  // Cluster standard errors at country level

* Notes:
* 1. No control variables included (baseline specification)
* 2. year FE: Controls for time-varying shocks common to all units
* 3. country FE: Controls for time-invariant country characteristics
* 4. cluster(country): Accounts for within-country correlation
* 5. The coefficient on 'did' gives the average treatment effect
